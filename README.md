This Project offers you full auto data analyze workflows. The file input, data select and plotting of diagrams and tables are all automatical. It will definitly make your data analyze experiences easier.

To install, you can run command `git clone github.com/KylrZhou/Kylrs-mm-analyzer`, then switch to your download dir `cd Kylr-mm-anlyzer`, use command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required packages. Finally run `python main.py` to start the program.

## Using

The software is CLI included and detail instructions are in the CLI as well. The only caveat is that whne you first time run this porgram, a default workdir(the dir you store experiment results) setting is needed. The workdir must be a `absolute path`, `~`and`.` are not allowed.
